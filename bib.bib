  abstract = {Graphene is a rapidly rising star on the horizon of materials science and condensed-matter physics.
This strictly two-dimensional material exhibits exceptionally high crystal and electronic quality, and,
despite its short history, has already revealed a cornucopia of new physics and potential applications,
which are briefl y discussed here. Whereas one can be certain of the realness of applications only
when commercial products appear, graphene no longer requires any further proof of its importance
in terms of fundamental physics. Owing to its unusual electronic spectrum, graphene has led to the
emergence of a new paradigm of ‘relativistic’ condensed-matter physics, where quantum relativistic
phenomena, some of which are unobservable in high-energy physics, can now be mimicked and
tested in table-top experiments. More generally, graphene represents a conceptually new class of
materials that are only one atom thick, and, on this basis, offers new inroads into low-dimensional
physics that has never ceased to surprise and continues to provide a fertile ground for applications.},

  abstract = {This article reviews the basic theoretical aspects of graphene, a one-atom-thick allotrope of carbon,
with unusual two-dimensional Dirac-like electronic excitations. The Dirac electrons can be controlled
by application of external electric and magnetic fields, or by altering sample geometry and/or topology.
The Dirac electrons behave in unusual ways in tunneling, confinement, and the integer quantum Hall
effect. The electronic properties of graphene stacks are discussed and vary with stacking order and
number of layers. Edge !surface" states in graphene depend on the edge termination !zigzag or
armchair" and affect the physical properties of nanoribbons. Different types of disorder modify the
Dirac equation leading to unusual spectroscopic and transport properties. The effects of
electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in single layer and multilayer graphene are also
presented.},
