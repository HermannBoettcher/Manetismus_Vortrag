  abstract = {Graphene is a rapidly rising star on the horizon of materials science and condensed-matter physics.
This strictly two-dimensional material exhibits exceptionally high crystal and electronic quality, and,
despite its short history, has already revealed a cornucopia of new physics and potential applications,
which are briefl y discussed here. Whereas one can be certain of the realness of applications only
when commercial products appear, graphene no longer requires any further proof of its importance
in terms of fundamental physics. Owing to its unusual electronic spectrum, graphene has led to the
emergence of a new paradigm of ‘relativistic’ condensed-matter physics, where quantum relativistic
phenomena, some of which are unobservable in high-energy physics, can now be mimicked and
tested in table-top experiments. More generally, graphene represents a conceptually new class of
materials that are only one atom thick, and, on this basis, offers new inroads into low-dimensional
physics that has never ceased to surprise and continues to provide a fertile ground for applications.},
